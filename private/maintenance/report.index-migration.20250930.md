# Index Migration Completion Report
Date: 2025-09-30
Migration: 2-digit (nn) → 3-digit (nnn) index system

## Executive Summary
Successfully migrated the ai-project-guide project from 2-digit to 3-digit file indexing system with semantic range allocation. All files renamed, all references updated, all verification checks passed.

## Migration Statistics

### Files Modified
- **8** guide files renamed (git mv, history preserved)
- **2** file-naming-conventions.md files updated
- **1** prompt.ai-project.system.md updated (50+ references)
- **8** guide files internally updated
- **6** supporting files updated
- **3** root-level files updated (CLAUDE.md, readme.md, directory-structure.md)
- **1** private slice file updated
- **Total: 29 files modified** across 9 phases

### References Updated
- **150+** cross-references updated
- **0** broken links remaining
- **0** 2-digit guide references remaining (except historical CHANGELOG.md)
- **11** HLD references correctly migrated to 050 range

## Index Range Schema Implemented

```
000-009: Core AI-project guides
010-049: Reserved for future process extensions
050-089: Architecture and system design (40 slots)
090-099: Specialized guides
100-799: Active work items (700 slots)
800-899: Feature documents
900-949: Maintenance and operations
950-999: System-reserved
```

## Files Renamed (Git History Preserved)

All renames performed with `git mv` at 100% similarity:

1. guide.ai-project.00-process.md → guide.ai-project.000-process.md
2. guide.ai-project.01-concept.md → guide.ai-project.001-concept.md
3. guide.ai-project.02-spec.md → guide.ai-project.002-spec.md
4. guide.ai-project.03-slice-planning.md → guide.ai-project.003-slice-planning.md
5. guide.ai-project.04-slice-design.md → guide.ai-project.004-slice-design.md
6. guide.ai-project.06-task-expansion.md → guide.ai-project.006-task-expansion.md
7. guide.ai-project.90-code-review.md → guide.ai-project.090-code-review.md
8. guide.ai-project.91-legacy-task-migration.md → guide.ai-project.091-legacy-task-migration.md

## Critical Architecture Migration

**Special Case:** HLD files migrated from 003 to 050 range
- Rationale: Architecture documents belong in dedicated 050-089 range
- Pattern: `03-hld.{project}.md` → `050-hld.{project}.md`
- Occurrences updated: 11 across 6 files
- Verification: ✅ No 2-digit HLD references remain

## Verification Results

### Pattern Search Results
✅ Guide file references: Only historical CHANGELOG.md contains 2-digit references (preserved intentionally)
✅ HLD references: All use 050 range
✅ Slice/task patterns: All use nnn format
✅ File existence: All 8 guide files exist with 3-digit names
✅ Git history: Preserved via git mv (100% similarity)

### Files With Intentionally Preserved Historical References
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Contains historical documentation of past file naming changes

## Phase Completion Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 - Preparation | 3 | ✅ Complete | Inventory, cross-ref mapping, backup |
| 2 - File Naming Conventions | 2 | ✅ Complete | Both versions updated |
| 3 - Guide File Renaming | 1 | ✅ Complete | All 8 files renamed via git mv |
| 4 - System Prompt Updates | 2 | ✅ Complete | 50+ references updated |
| 5 - Guide File Cross-Refs | 8 | ✅ Complete | All guides internally consistent |
| 6 - Supporting File Updates | 6 | ✅ Complete | Includes directory-structure, readme |
| 7 - Private Project Files | 3 | ✅ Complete | Not committed (gitignored) |
| 8 - Verification | 4 | ✅ Complete | Found and fixed 3 missed references |
| 9 - Finalization | 4 | ✅ Complete | This report |

**Total: 34 tasks across 9 phases - 100% complete**

Branch: `feature/index-migration-nnn`
Ready for: Merge to main

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

1. ✅ All guide files renamed with git history preserved
2. ✅ All nn patterns replaced with nnn in prompts
3. ✅ Index range schema documented
4. ✅ All examples use 3-digit indices
5. ✅ HLD correctly in 050 range (not 003)
6. ✅ No broken references
7. ✅ Verification clean
8. ✅ Project-specific files consistent

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Benefits
- **1000 index values** available (vs 100 previously)
- **Semantic organization** via range allocation
- **Future-proof** expansion capability
- **Clear separation** of concerns (process vs architecture vs work)

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - This is a framework update, not affecting existing projects
- Old projects continue to work with legacy naming
- New projects automatically use 3-digit system via updated prompts

## Recommendations

### For Deployment
1. ✅ Merge feature branch to main
2. ✅ Update any external documentation referencing guide files
3. ✅ Notify users of new naming convention
4. ✅ Consider updating setup scripts if they reference specific guide files

### For Future Work
- Consider adding automated verification tests for index range compliance
- Document migration path for existing projects (use 091-legacy-task-migration guide)
- Update any IDE/editor snippets that reference guide file names

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Systematic phase-by-phase approach prevented errors
- Git mv preserved full history
- Replace-all operations worked reliably
- Verification caught edge cases

### Challenges Encountered
- A few missed references found during verification (expected, caught, fixed)
- Private directory gitignored (acceptable - project-specific files)
- CHANGELOG.md intentionally preserves historical 2-digit references (correct)

### Process Improvements for Future Migrations
- Consider automated regex-based verification script
- Create checklist of "commonly missed" files
- Document pattern for handling historical vs current references

## Conclusion

The index migration from 2-digit to 3-digit system with semantic range allocation has been completed successfully. All 34 tasks across 9 phases are complete, all verification checks passed, and the system is ready for deployment.

The new 3-digit system with range-based semantics provides significant organizational benefits and room for growth while maintaining backward compatibility through clear migration paths.

**Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
**Ready for: Merge to main**
**Verification: All checks passed**
