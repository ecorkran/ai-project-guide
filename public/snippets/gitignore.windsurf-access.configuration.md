## Windsurf Cascade File Ignoring and .gitignore Handling

**Does Windsurf Cascade have a .cascadeignore or other specific ignore file?**

Windsurf Cascade does not use a file named `.cascadeignore`. Instead, it relies on two main mechanisms for controlling which files are indexed or accessible:

- **.codeiumignore**: You can add a `.codeiumignore` file at the root of your workspace. This file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and lets you specify files or directories that Cascade should ignore. Files listed here will not be viewed, edited, or created by Cascade[1][5].
- **.windsurfignore**: For broader Windsurf context awareness and indexing, you can use a `.windsurfignore` file, also using a `.gitignore`-like syntax, to control what is indexed by Windsurf's AI engine[3].

**Does Cascade ignore files in .gitignore by default?**

Yes, by default, Cascade and Windsurf's indexing engine ignore files and directories listed in your `.gitignore`[5]. This means any file in `.gitignore` will not be accessible to Cascade unless you change the default settings.

**Is there a setting to allow Cascade to access files in .gitignore?**

Yes. You can enable Cascade's access to files that are listed in your `.gitignore` via a specific setting:

- Go to Windsurf Settings (top right dropdown or Command Palette → Open Windsurf Settings Page).
- Find the setting called “Cascade Gitignore Access.”
- By default, this is off. Toggle it on to allow Cascade to access files that match patterns in your `.gitignore`[4][3].

**Can .codeiumignore override .gitignore?**

Currently, there is an issue where exception rules in `.codeiumignore` (using the `!pattern` syntax) do not override exclusions in `.gitignore`. If a file is ignored by `.gitignore`, even explicitly allowing it in `.codeiumignore` does not make it accessible to Cascade or Codeium tools[2]. This is recognized as a limitation, and the expected behavior would be for `.codeiumignore` to take precedence, but as of now, this override does not work.

## Summary Table

| Mechanism             | Purpose                                      | Default Behavior                             | Can Override .gitignore?           |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| .gitignore            | Git version control ignore                   | Cascade ignores these files by default       | Only via setting, not by file rule |
| .codeiumignore        | Cascade/Codeium-specific ignore              | Ignores files listed here                    | Cannot override .gitignore         |
| .windsurfignore       | Windsurf indexing-specific ignore            | Ignores files listed here                    | Separate from .gitignore           |
| Cascade Gitignore Access (setting) | Toggle to allow access to .gitignore files | Off by default; turn on to allow access      | Yes, via UI setting                |

## Recommendation

If you need Cascade to reference a file that is currently in `.gitignore` (and should remain so for Git), you have two options:

- **Enable "Cascade Gitignore Access" in Windsurf Settings** to allow Cascade to see all files in `.gitignore`[4][3].
- If you want more granular control, use `.codeiumignore` to ignore other files, but be aware that you cannot currently use `.codeiumignore` to override `.gitignore` exclusions for specific files[2].

This lets you keep your file in `.gitignore` for Git, but still make it accessible to Cascade when needed.
