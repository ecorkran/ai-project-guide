### Git Rules

#### Branch Naming
A branch corresponds to one unit of work: slice implementation (Phase 6). Planning work (Phases 0–5: concept, initiative plan, architecture, slice plan, slice design, task breakdown, and reviews of those artifacts) does not get its own branch — it commits directly to the current integration target (see below).

- **Slice work** → `{index}-slice.{name}`, where `{index}` is the slice's index and `{name}` is the document name without the `.md` extension.

##### Integration branch
A project may configure an **optional** integration branch that work forks from and merges into, instead of `main`. Read it with `cf config get git.integration_branch`. This key is optional and defaults to empty:

- **Unset (default):** no change from plain historical behavior. Work branches fork from `main` and merge into `main`, named exactly `{index}-{type}.{name}` — no prefix.
- **Set** (e.g. `dev/erik`):
  - Work branches are named the same as when unset — `{index}-{type}.{name}` (e.g. `910-slice.foo`), with no prefix.
  - Work branches fork **from** `{integration_branch}`, not `main`.
  - Work branches merge **into** `{integration_branch}`, not `main`.
  - **Hard rule: never merge to `main` when `integration_branch` is set.** Syncing `{integration_branch}` from `main`, and eventually merging `{integration_branch}` into `main`, are PM-only actions outside automation scope — never perform either as part of normal slice/planning workflow, only if the Project Manager explicitly instructs it as a standalone action.

The integration branch affects **git topology only** (fork point and merge target) — not the branch name. It does not move documents or change where artifacts resolve — the `project-documents/user/...` layout under the branch is unchanged. The configured value is relative and contained (never absolute, never `..`, no trailing slash, no Windows drive/`\`); `cf` rejects invalid values when the key is set.

Before starting work:
1. read `cf config get git.integration_branch`; call its value (or `main` if empty) the **target**

**If committing planning work (Phases 0–5):**
2. ensure you are on the target. Do not create or switch to a work branch. Commit directly.

**If starting slice implementation (Phase 6):**
2. determine the branch name per the rules above (no prefix, regardless of target)
3. verify you are on the target or the expected slice branch
4. if the expected slice branch does not exist, create it from the target: `git checkout -b {branch-name} {target}`
5. if the branch already exists, switch to it: `git checkout {branch-name}`
6. never start work from another unit's branch unless explicitly instructed
7. if in doubt, STOP and ask the Project Manager

A slice branch merges into the target when its implementation is done. Do not hold a branch open across units. Do not delete branches unless specifically instructed to do so.

#### Commit Messages
Use semantic commit prefixes. The goal is a readable `git log --oneline`.

Format: `{type}: {short imperative summary}`

Types:
- `feat` — New functionality or capability
- `fix` — Bug fix
- `refactor` — Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `style` — Formatting, whitespace, linting (no logic change)
- `guides` - Update or addition to project guides (system/project level)
- `docs` — Update or addition to user/ guides or documentation (slices, readme, etc)
- `review` — Code review, design review, or audit documentation
- `package` - Updates related to packaging, npm, package.json, PyPi, etc
- `chore` — Build config, dependencies, tooling, CI

Actions (optional, use if applicable):
- `update`: primarily update/edit to existing information
- `add`: primarily addition of new code or information
- `extract`: primarily used in refactoring
- `reduce`: if primary work involves reduction or streamlining

#### Guidelines:
- Summary is imperative mood ("add X" not "added X" or "adds X")
- Keep to ~72 characters
- No period at end
- Scope is optional but useful in monorepos: `feat(core): add template variable resolution`

#### Examples:
feat: add context_build MCP tool
fix: update to handle missing template directory gracefully
refactor(core): extract service instantiation into shared helper
docs: add MCP server installation instructions to README
test: add unit tests for prompt_list tool handler
chore: update @modelcontextprotocol/server to v2.1
